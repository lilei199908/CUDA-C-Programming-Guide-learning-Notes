## CUDA Graphs

CUDA Graphs 是一种优化 GPU 工作提交的方式，通过将任务的定义、实例化和执行分离，能够显著减少每次内核启动的开销。以下是对其原理和优势的详细说明：

### Background: Overhead in Streams
When a kernel is placed into a CUDA stream, the host driver performs a series of preparatory operations before the kernel executes on the GPU. These steps include:

- Setting up the kernel parameters.
- Preparing GPU resources.
- Launching the kernel.

These operations introduce an **overhead cost** that must be paid for each kernel launched. For kernels with short execution times, this overhead can become a substantial portion of the total end-to-end execution time, reducing overall efficiency.

### How CUDA Graphs Optimize Work Submission
CUDA Graphs address this issue by breaking the work submission process into three distinct stages:

1. **Definition Phase**
   - In this stage, the program creates a **graph template** that describes:
     - The operations (e.g., kernel launches, memory copies) to be performed.
     - The dependencies between these operations.
   - This step is like designing a blueprint of the workflow, without executing anything yet.

2. **Instantiation Phase**
   - The graph template is "snapshotted" into an **executable graph**.
   - During instantiation:
     - The graph is validated to ensure correctness.
     - Much of the setup and initialization work (e.g., resource allocation, parameter binding) is precomputed.
   - The goal is to minimize the overhead required at launch time, making execution as efficient as possible.

3. **Execution Phase**
   - The resulting **executable graph** can be launched into a CUDA stream, just like traditional CUDA work (e.g., a single kernel).
   - Key advantage: Once instantiated, the graph can be executed multiple times without repeating the instantiation process, eliminating redundant overhead.

### Benefits
- **Reduced Overhead**: By performing setup work once during instantiation, graphs eliminate the per-kernel overhead seen in streams.
- **Reusability**: An executable graph can be reused across multiple launches, making it ideal for repetitive tasks.
- **Performance**: For short-running kernels, the end-to-end execution time is significantly improved, as the overhead becomes a smaller fraction of the total cost.
